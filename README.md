Using Codex, NanoClaw can dynamically rewrite its code to customize its feature set for your needs.

**New:** First AI assistant to support agent swarms. Spin up teams of agents that collaborate in your chat.

## Why I Built NanoClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an impressive project, but I wouldn't have been able to sleep if I had given complex software I didn't understand full access to my life. OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and 70+ dependencies. Its security is at the application level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than true OS-level isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.

NanoClaw provides that same core functionality, but in a codebase small enough to understand: one process and a handful of files. Agents run in their own Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not merely behind permission checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/NanoClaw.git
cd NanoClaw
bash setup.sh
npx tsx setup/index.ts --step environment
npx tsx setup/index.ts --step container -- --runtime docker
```

Then have Codex run the setup flow in `.agents/skills/setup/SKILL.md`, or run the remaining setup steps manually from that file (channel auth, registration, mounts, service, verify).

> **Note:** Skills are stored in `.agents/skills/`. In this Codex branch, apply channel skills with `npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .agents/skills/<skill-name>` (for example `add-whatsapp`), then run the corresponding `setup/index.ts --step ...` commands.

## Philosophy

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files and no microservices. If you want to understand the full NanoClaw codebase, ask your coding agent to walk you through it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker) and they can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for the individual user.** NanoClaw isn't a monolithic framework; it's software that fits each user's exact needs. Instead of becoming bloatware, NanoClaw is designed to be bespoke. You make your own fork and have Codex modify it to match your needs.

**Customization = code changes.** No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that it's safe to make changes.

**AI-native.**
- No installation wizard; the coding agent guides setup.
- No monitoring dashboard; ask the agent what's happening.
- No debugging tools; describe the problem and the agent fixes it.

**Skills over features.** Instead of adding features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase, contributors submit skills like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.

**Best harness, best model.** This experimental branch runs Codex in the container harness for coding and problem-solving tasks, and is designed to be modified by the agent as you customize your fork.

## What It Supports

- **Multi-channel messaging** - Talk to your assistant from WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, or Gmail. Add channels with skills like `/add-whatsapp` or `/add-telegram`. Run one or many at the same time.
- **Isolated group context** - Every group gets base context from root `SOUL.md`, can add group-specific context via `groups/{group}/SOUL.md`, and runs in its own container sandbox with isolated workspace mounts.
- **Main channel** - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every group is completely isolated
- **Scheduled tasks** - Recurring jobs that run the agent and can message you back
- **Web access** - Search and fetch content from the Web
- **Container isolation** - Agents are sandboxed in Apple Container (macOS) or Docker (macOS/Linux)
- **Agent Swarms** - Spin up teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks. NanoClaw is the first personal AI assistant to support agent swarms.
- **Optional integrations** - Add Gmail (`/add-gmail`) and more via skills

## Usage

Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@Andy`):

```
@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:
```
@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
```

### Run and Control NanoClaw

On Linux (`systemd --user`), use:

```bash
# Start
systemctl --user start nanoclaw

# Stop
systemctl --user stop nanoclaw

# Restart
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw

# Status
systemctl --user status nanoclaw --no-pager -n 40

# Logs
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log

# Full agent audit log (daily, all groups)
tail -f data/vivian-audit/$(date +%F).log
```

After code changes (single command):

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

Optional fast path (skip container rebuild when only host TS changed):

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild-nanoclaw.sh --skip-container
```

## Customizing

NanoClaw doesn't use configuration files. To make changes, just tell Codex what you want:

- "Change the trigger word to @Bob"
- "Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"
- "Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"
- "Store conversation summaries weekly"

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

The codebase is small enough that the agent can safely modify it.

## Contributing

**Don't add features. Add skills.**

If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (`.agents/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md`) that teaches the coding agent how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.

Users then run `/add-telegram` on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.

### RFS (Request for Skills)

Skills we'd like to see:

**Communication Channels**
- `/add-signal` - Add Signal as a channel

**Session Management**
- `/clear` - Add a `/clear` command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session).

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- Codex CLI (host-side, optional but recommended for guided setup/customization)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)

## Architecture

```
Channels --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (Codex runtime) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Channels are added via skills and self-register at startup — the orchestrator connects whichever ones have credentials present. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with filesystem isolation. Only mounted directories are accessible. Per-group message queue with concurrency control. IPC via filesystem.

For the full architecture details, see [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md).

Key files:
- `src/index.ts` - Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation
- `src/channels/registry.ts` - Channel registry (self-registration at startup)
- `src/ipc.ts` - IPC watcher and task processing
- `src/router.ts` - Message formatting and outbound routing
- `src/group-queue.ts` - Per-group queue with global concurrency limit
- `src/container-runner.ts` - Spawns streaming agent containers
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` - Runs scheduled tasks
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite operations (messages, groups, sessions, state)
- `SOUL.md` - Base behavior/memory loaded for all groups
- `groups/*/SOUL.md` - Per-group memory

## FAQ

**Why Docker?**

Docker provides cross-platform support (macOS, Linux and even Windows via WSL2) and a mature ecosystem. On macOS, you can optionally switch to Apple Container via `/convert-to-apple-container` for a lighter-weight native runtime.

**Can I run this on Linux?**

Yes. Docker is the default runtime and works on both macOS and Linux. Run the setup steps from `.agents/skills/setup/SKILL.md`.

**Is this secure?**

Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full security model.

**Why no configuration files?**

We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize NanoClaw so that the code does exactly what they want, rather than configuring a generic system. If you prefer having config files, you can ask the coding agent to add them.

**Can I use third-party or open-source models?**

Yes. NanoClaw supports any API-compatible model endpoint. Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-token-here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com
```

This allows you to use:
- Local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with an API proxy
- Open-source models hosted on [Together AI](https://together.ai), [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai), etc.
- Custom model deployments with OpenAI-compatible APIs

Note: The model endpoint must support the OpenAI API format for best compatibility.

**How do I debug issues?**

Ask Codex. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach that underlies NanoClaw.

**Why isn't the setup working for me?**

If you have issues, ask Codex to run the diagnostics from `.agents/skills/debug/SKILL.md` and repair failures step-by-step. If you find an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup skill instructions.

**What changes will be accepted into the codebase?**

Only security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements will be accepted to the base configuration. That's all.

Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.

This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.
